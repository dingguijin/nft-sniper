These tokens represent fungible and tradable assets or utilities that reside on their own blockchains. Crypto tokens are often used to fundraise for crowd sales, but they can also be used as a substitute for other things. These tokens are usually created, distributed, sold, and circulated through the standard initial coin offering (ICO) process, which involves a crowdfunding exercise to fund project development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoad Map \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ1 2022\r\n\r\n●  Restructure Application.\r\n●  Rename Project.\r\n●  update social media and listed platforms.\r\n●  Update website, white paper and Road Map.\r\n●  Start Update.\r\n●  Update code and add new nodes\r\n\r\nQ2 2022\r\n\r\n●  Create LINXY ID.\r\n●  Create NODESH.\r\n●  Create New PC Wallets.\r\n●  Create new Android Wallet.\r\n●  Publish extension wallet for Firefox and Chrome.\r\n●  Make the creation of smart contracts available on the LINXY network.\r\n●  Launch Tokenization Platform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ3 2022\r\n\r\n●  Search partnerships with Exchange for acceptance of LINXY tokens in the market.\r\n●  Expand partnerships with exchanges.\r\n●  Start construction of the NFT LINXY platform.\r\n●  Start building the LINXY Hub.\r\n●  Start marketing to expand the community.\r\n\r\nQ1 2023\r\n\r\n●  Launch NFT LINXY platform.\r\n●  Launch LINXY Hub.\r\n●  Review code and update protocol.\r\n●  Update Road Map with new goals and improvements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTeam\r\n\r\nAnzhel Milenov\r\nCEO & Founder\r\n\r\nDeveloper.

The Virtual Machine will have few, predefined, internal modules available and will be able to interact with the NodeSH database limited to its own sphere of competence.\r\nCompiler: although Smart Contracts are written in Javascript, the compiler will allow you to translate certain predefined rules (such as reading and writing the database) into a native language capable of communicating with the NodeSH.\r\nNodeSH Modules\r\nAnd here we are at the most important part: the modules. Although we can continue to call them “Smart Contracts” in fact the platform allows you to create modules / extensions / whatever you prefer to call them for the NodeSH. These modules will then be enabled within the NodeSH and then maintained by one or more specific NodeSH. Here we come to the first point on our list of required features: scalability .\r\n\r\nThe modules are not natively included in all the NodeSH, but only in those that have the interest of maintaining them and therefore the interest in providing more or less computing power for their execution.\r\n\r\nThis means that a specific application can be maintained only by its creator or by all those interested in using it, this therefore means that the number of interested parties will grow with the increase in users and therefore the system will always have computing power available. to serve different users.\r\n\r\nThis type of approach has already been used in decentralized applications such as IPFS or Torrent.\r\n\r\nClock and automatism\r\nThe specific interaction with the NodeSH allows to solve another big problem encountered in other Smart Contracts platforms, namely the automatisms. While it is generally accepted that the smart contract “executes itself on the basis of specific rules”, this idea is drastically wrong.\r\n\r\nTaking the example of Ethereum, a Smart Contract may possibly have “automatically” conditions such that if executed (and we repeat the if ), it will lead to a change of state within it.\r\n\r\nThis is because the Ethereum Virtual Machine does not have a real clock or a fundamental characteristic of all electronic machines and which allows to synchronize by means of a certain cycle . In computers, for example, it is calculated in Hertz (GHz) and defines the amount to perform operations that the computer can perform every second.\r\n\r\nClearly to extend the concept of clock to the blockchain we must abstract from the concept related to computers and think that the VM clock (i.e. the moment when the machine synchronizes) is the emission of a block, which in the LINXY network is about 1 minute .\r\n\r\nThis means that we can think of having our Smart Contract execute at least one operation every block, that is when a “cycle” has been concluded.\r\n\r\nWe have therefore created the basis for the automatisms, all Smart Contracts will be able to call the function onBlock and self-execute the code regardless of whether someone calls or does not call the Smart Contract itself!\r\n\r\nImmutability and updatability\r\nSpeaking of blockchain and Smart Contract, we can only mention one of the fundamental characteristics that the code must have: immutability.\r\n\r\nImmutability is guaranteed by the blockchain as the code is not directly executed from a file, but this file must first be loaded into an address, thanks to the techniques we know. The code executed by the VM and by the user is therefore well defined and static and we have the guarantee that the code has been published by its author thanks to a double signature process.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor trading these tokens we are still looking for partnerships with exchanges, but don’t worry our team has been thinking about various trading strategies for the tokens in our network.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoyed the post, we will create post about our new services to familiarize you with everything that is coming.\r\n\r\nUntil the next post!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Upgrade Your LINX Wallet to Linxy Finance\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new wallets version 1.7.0.0-LINXYProtocol have their data compatible with versions 1.6.0.0, but there were some changes in their directories, to fix it is simple:\r\n\r\n\r\n1º STEP\r\nGo to :\r\n\r\nWindows: C:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Roaming\\LINX\r\nMac: ~/Library/Application Support/LINX\r\nUbuntu: ~/.LINX (Usually located in the root folder or main directory of your VPS)\r\n\r\nRename .LINX to .LINXY, so it looks like this:\r\nWindows: C:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Roaming\\LINXY\r\nMac: ~/Library/Application Support/LINXY\r\nUbuntu: ~/.LINXY (Usually located in the root folder or main directory of your VPS)\r\n\r\n2º STEP\r\nGo to the directory and look for your LINX.conf file and rename it to LINXY.conf, the rest of the files can continue as is.\r\n\r\nIf you use the LINX.pid file it must also be renamed in your settings the system will create a new PID file with the name LINXY.pid and you need to rename it\r\n\r\n\r\nLINXY Virtual Machine (LINXY VM)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis describes the functioning of the LINXY Virtual Machine, the reasons for its creation and the implementation in the context of the NodeSH that will allow you to create and execute “Smart Contracts” (software that are executed and that maintain a state within a decentralized network ) thus creating an indefinite number of new use cases.\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nLINXY was born from a fork of PIVX and rests its blockchain foundations directly on the concepts of Bitcoin (being PIVX a fork of Dash, which in turn is a fork of Bitcoin). This means that within the LINXY blockchain there is no reference to the concept of Smart Contracts.\r\n\r\nAlthough we strongly believe that decentralized applications do not largely need Smart Contracts on the other hand, we realize that there are many other applications that need to work with a strongly decentralized and highly scalable logic. That said, we started thinking about the possibility of allowing third party developers to use our “backend” technology, that is the NodeSH, without actually corrupting them or having to act directly inside the source code.\r\n\r\nUp to now, all the applications that required to interact with an “additional” logic have had to create new projects that interact with the NodeSH, thus delegating the maintenance of particular logics to additional software.\r\n\r\nAfter a careful analysis of the various existing Smart Contracts platforms, we tried to define the “qualities” that our system should have:\r\n\r\nScalability: the system must be highly scalable, guaranteeing stability in the use of the platform as its use increases.\r\nAutomatism: the system must be able to “self-execute” or perform certain actions in a totally automatic way.\r\nSimplicity: the system must give the developer ease of development without having to learn new programming languages.\r\nUpdatability: the system must guarantee the updating of the software while maintaining its immutability.\r\nWe believe that the system designed can actually satisfy all the above requirements, in the next paragraphs we will explain how.\r\n\r\nNodeSH, VM e compiler\r\nAt the basis of the functioning of the platform we have three entities:\r\n*/\r\n\r\npragma solidity ^0.5.17;\r\ninterface IERC20 {\r\n    function
